            <p>Well, as I mentioned in one of my previous blog posts, I've been programming for quite some time now. I
                will go more in depth here though <em>(STORY TIMEEE WOOO)</em>.</p>

            <p>It all began one beautiful spring day during spring break. My father was, as per usual, watching some TV
                channel where, during one of their programs, they invite successful Bulgarians to tell their stories and
                how they succeeded in life. Well, that day, they had invited <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">Svetlin
                    Nakov</strong>. Most of you might not know him, but he's the CEO and co-founder of <strong
                    class="text-indigo-900/80">SoftUni</strong>. </p>

            <blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 italic">"But WTF is that???" you might say.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Well, <em>SoftUni</em>, hmm... ðŸ¤” oh yeah! It must be <em>Software University</em>. "Yeah, but how does
                it work?" Well, <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">SoftUni</strong> is like an online bootcamp selling
                online courses. Anyways, since we cleared this out, I can continue. So, as per usual, I was playing some
                videogame (I don't even remember which one at this point), and my father barged into my room telling me
                to come watch something with him (he always does that and never tells me what). So what do I do? I join
                him. We watch the whole interview, and my father asks me whether I would like to learn how to code. I
                wasn't quite sure, but I decided to give it a try. And so I did.</p>

            <p>Now comes the question though... What language do I pick? So, after a quick YouTube montage of the
                <em>coolest programming languages</em> later, I had my choice ready. I was going to become the best
                <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">C#</strong> developer. "Yeah, but why C#?" <em>Good question</em>.
                <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">VIDEOGAMES</strong>. I wanted to create videogames, and that just
                happened to be the language the <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">Unity</strong> game engine uses. So I
                enrolled in my first course: "Programming Basics with C#". I passed it with a <strong
                    class="text-indigo-900/80">6.00/6.00</strong>. My father encouraged me to pursue this since he saw
                my potential. And I did. I enrolled in the next course, "Programming Fundamentals with C#". You might be
                asking now:
            </p>

            <blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 italic">"Is he really going to just go through all of
                the courses he passed one by one?"</blockquote>

            <p><strong>No</strong>. This course is where it all changed. It was during the summer. What do 14-15 year
                old teenagers do during the summer? They spend their time outside or in front of their computers,
                leaving no time for studying. I was no exception. I watched the first 2 lectures, then I started falling
                behind since I wasn't attending the lectures... and I <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">failed</strong>
                the course ðŸ˜”. I had convinced myself that I didnâ€™t want to learn this anymoreâ€”not because I didnâ€™t like
                it, but because I was just <em>too lazy</em> to catch up on my missed course lectures.</p>

            <blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 italic">"What did you do?"</blockquote>

            <p>Weeeeeeell.... at the time, I was coding on my insanely good (for the time) <strong
                    class="text-indigo-900/80">Thinkpad</strong>. I had saved up some money and had only one goal:
                <em>to buy myself a personal computer</em>. My console was no longer cutting it for me since all my
                friends could talk on <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">Discord</strong> and I was ALONE. So I talked
                it through with my father aaaand he said that I could only get a PC if I continued with programming and
                this time, <em>pass</em> my exam for the course. I agreed. I learned all the material in a month instead
                of the provided 3 (cuz Iâ€™m that smart, yes), and... I didnâ€™t get my PC (I know, it sucks).
            </p>

            <blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 italic">"Wtf, why did your dad screw you over like
                that?"</blockquote>

            <p>He didn't. <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">COVID</strong> did. Everyone was at home and using their
                PCs or buying new ones, aaaaand the <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">GPU prices skyrocketed</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>Anyways, I continued to learn all about <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">SQL</strong> and databases,
                <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">.NET</strong>, and <strong
                    class="text-indigo-900/80">EntityFramework</strong>. After that, I studied <strong
                    class="text-indigo-900/80">JavaScript</strong> and created multiple webapps with <strong
                    class="text-indigo-900/80">Node</strong>, <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">Express</strong>,
                <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">Page.js</strong>, and <strong
                    class="text-indigo-900/80">Handlebars</strong>. Then I learned <strong
                    class="text-indigo-900/80">Angular</strong> and <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">MongoDB</strong>,
                aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand I learned <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">HTML & CSS</strong>(since I
                had just been winging it up until then ðŸ˜…). After that, I picked up <strong class="text-indigo-900/80">React</strong>, creating
                multiple projects with it. And this brings us to today. Iâ€™m at university, feeling kind of
                <em>overqualified</em> and waiting for something new to learn. Luckily, my favorite diva, <strong
                    class="text-indigo-900/80">Frans Blauw</strong>, is also my lecturer in Computer Science, where Iâ€™ve
                learned a bunch of new things.

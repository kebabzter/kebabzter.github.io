            <p>So why did I end up choosing <strong class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">ICT</strong> instead of let's say
                <em>Engineering</em>,
                <em>Architecture</em>, or who knows <em>Chemistry</em> or <em>Geography</em>?
            </p>

            <p>Well, since I was a kid, I've always been attached to <strong
                    class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">computers</strong> and
                <strong class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">videogames</strong>. To be absolutely honest, I don't quite remember
                the age I was when I
                had my
                first interaction with a computer, but I remember it was <strong class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">my
                    father's</strong> initiative.
            </p>

            <p>He had decided to teach me how to type using a keyboard. It was quite the process since he made me
                write
                the whole <em>Iliad</em> <strong class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">word for word</strong> in Bulgarian while
                reading it on the side.
                Crazy, right? I must have been probably in 2nd or 3rd grade since I had to be able to read (duh). If
                you
                think it sounds quite <strong class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">boring</strong> and <strong
                    class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">dull</strong>, you might be right, but I
                didn't mind it at the time.</p>

            <p>A few weeks later, now that I was <em>weaponized</em> with my mouse and keyboard, I started browsing
                the
                internet for what every kid would... <strong class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">GAMES</strong> (unbelievable).
                Since I was a boy, I was
                not
                going to play no <em>girl games</em>‚Äîcuz that's for girls. And what is more manly than
                <strong class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">cars</strong>? Probably a lot of things, but that was at the top of
                my list back then. So
                the
                search was "–∏–≥—Ä–∏ —Å –∫–æ–ª–∏" or <em>"games with cars"</em> in English.
            </p>

            <p>The first website that popped up was <em>igraiigri.com</em>. I opened it and I was <em>hooked</em>. I
                would play games for 2-3 hours a day since that was all my screentime for the day, only if I had
                read my
                daily book pages.</p>

            <p>A few years go by, and now I am in 7th grade. I'm still a gamer, but I start learning that you can
                <em>create</em> games, and I am <em>intrigued</em>. Yeah, but how? Well, <strong
                    class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">YouTube</strong>
                came
                to the rescue and answered that question. That's how I was introduced to <strong
                    class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">C#</strong>. I
                enrolled
                in an online course at <strong class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">SoftUni</strong> for programming basics with
                C# and, boy oh boy, was
                this
                my new thing. I could spend hours coding without being bothered. It was like videogames but with
                <em>maths</em> and typing. That's all I needed at the time.
            </p>

            <p>Fast forward a few years and I‚Äôm in 11th grade. I graduate from <strong
                    class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">SoftUni</strong> with an
                almost
                perfect score: <strong class="text-pastel-baby-900/80">5.99/6.00</strong>. I have a <em>Fullstack
                    developer</em> diploma and have
                created and completed multiple projects. So what did I do next? Well, I decided that after a 5-year
                run
                of coding every day, I needed a breaküòÖ. And so I did, until 12th grade. Then I started creating
                more
                projects and learning new frameworks, but I really dove in deep.</p>

            <p>I had to choose a university to study at now. But what would I study? "Well," I thought to myself, "I
                will just go and study <em>Computer Science</em> since that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm already good at and don‚Äôt
                want to
                drop it." And so I did.</p>

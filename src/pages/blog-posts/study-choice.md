# Study choice
**October 17, 2024**

So why did I end up choosing **ICT** instead of let's say *Engineering*, *Architecture*, or who knows *Chemistry* or *Geography*?

Well, since I was a kid, I've always been attached to **computers** and **videogames**. To be absolutely honest, I don't quite remember the age I was when I had my first interaction with a computer, but I remember it was **my father's** initiative.

He had decided to teach me how to type using a keyboard. It was quite the process since he made me write the whole *Iliad* **word for word** in Bulgarian while reading it on the side. Crazy, right? I must have been probably in 2nd or 3rd grade since I had to be able to read (duh). If you think it sounds quite **boring** and **dull**, you might be right, but I didn't mind it at the time.

A few weeks later, now that I was *weaponized* with my mouse and keyboard, I started browsing the internet for what every kid would... **GAMES** (unbelievable). Since I was a boy, I was not going to play no *girl games*—cuz that's for girls. And what is more manly than **cars**? Probably a lot of things, but that was at the top of my list back then. So the search was "игри с коли" or *"games with cars"* in English.

The first website that popped up was *igraiigri.com*. I opened it and I was *hooked*. I would play games for 2-3 hours a day since that was all my screentime for the day, only if I had read my daily book pages.

A few years go by, and now I am in 7th grade. I'm still a gamer, but I start learning that you can *create* games, and I am *intrigued*. Yeah, but how? Well, **YouTube** came to the rescue and answered that question. That's how I was introduced to **C#**. I enrolled in an online course at **SoftUni** for programming basics with C# and, boy oh boy, was this my new thing. I could spend hours coding without being bothered. It was like videogames but with *maths* and typing. That's all I needed at the time.

Fast forward a few years and I’m in 11th grade. I graduate from **SoftUni** with an almost perfect score: **5.99/6.00**. I have a *Fullstack developer* diploma and have created and completed multiple projects. So what did I do next? Well, I decided that after a 5-year run of coding every day, I would take a break. And so I did, until 12th grade. Then I started creating more projects and learning new frameworks, but I really dove in deep.

I had to choose a university to study at now. But what would I study? "Well," I thought to myself, "I will just go and study *Computer Science* since that’s what I’m already good at and don’t want to drop it." And so I did.
